    <marquee><h1> Tom Brady </h1></marquee>

<h3>Brady was a lightly regarded prospect coming out of college, and was selected by the New England Patriots in the sixth round of 2000 NFL draft. He has subsequently played his entire professional career with the Patriots and has enjoyed a distinguished and decorated career including four Super Bowl wins, three Super Bowl MVPs and two League MVPs. Brady is considered among the greatest quarterbacks of all time.[3] In addition to his other accolades he has been named to the Pro Bowl eleven times, and led the league in passing three times. He holds numerous NFL post-season passing records, and has more post-season wins than any other quarterback. With Brady playing quarterback, the Patriots have never had a losing season, have won 13 division titles, and played in a remarkable ten AFC Championship Games from 2001 to 2015 (including five in a row from 2011 to 2015), winning six of them.
